* CutFlow:
            * can be done at any moment since the start of the game to the end
            * can be successful or unsuccessful (unsuccessful cut is when a player try to cut but other player cut first)
                * successful:
                    * the player was the first player to cut on this top card of discard pile)
                    * it was the right card
                * unsuccessful:
                    
                    if (isFirstPlayerToCut === false) {
                        * everyone sees the card
                    }

                    if (isRightCard === false) {
                        * everyone sees the card and draws a new card to the hand
                    }

            * triggerd by client event (uploads CGS: topDiscardPileCard, cardsOnTheHandOfTheCutter--, maybe cards on the hand of the  )
            * all top cards of the discard pile can be Cut
            * when a player finish a round

* Game Flow:

    *1. One player creates a table(becomes the tablehost).
        - client pusher(CP) initiates a pusher presence-channel
        - clientGameState(CGS) is initialized on the client.
        - roomOwner fires an event to initialize serverGameState.

    *2. Player waits more players to join(2 player min)
        - when a player enters the room, fires an event to update players CGS with new player

    *3. players need to click on some "ready" button to mark that they are ready to begin playing.
        - ready or not ready fires an event to update CGS with players ready
            - should be a delay to prevent users from abusing this button/event, overwhelming the channel
    
    *4. when every player on the room is ready, the room owner can start the game. So he does.
        - fires a "start" event
        - server listens and do calculations
            - randomize deck
            - draw 4 cards for each player (poker style) 
            - first player to enter room is first to play, other players are shuffled
            
    *6. pregame
        - 20s to choose the cards you want to look (the cards you chose are signalized on your table cards)
    
    *7. game
        - first round is a table round.
        - one card is drawn frmo deck and placed into discard pile
        - cutting is allowed
        - 5s duration
        - normal turns begin

    *8. Turn
        * if its first game of the table, the table host is the first player to play.
        else follow order
        * player chooses if he is drawing or if he knocks (knocks are only allowed after round 3)
        * player chooses if he is going to use the top card of discard pile(replace instantly by one of his cards) OR get a card from deck
            * if he gets a card from deck he will choose if he replaces one of his cards or if he discards the card he got and unleash the cards power
        * if discarded && card has powers, the turn will await until he uses the power, then go to next turn.
        * else: next turn;

    *9. KNOCK 
        * if a player knocks, he is instantly shielded(powers cant get into his cards) and the last round begins
    
    *10. Last round:
        * after the last turn of the last round, every card is turned up.
        * players have 5s to cut cards
        * after 5s, Score Board is shown

    *11. endgame:
        * unsubscribe from events and channels
        * score is shown and stored
        * player stay on the table gameless
        
    *11. Score
        * if the players knocks:
            * if he wins: -10 points plus cards
            * if he loses: +10 points plus cards
        * every else: cards scores
